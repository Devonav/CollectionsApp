Program Objective
This Java program demonstrates the usage of major classes in the Collections framework. It performs various operations on a list of names, including sorting, shuffling, searching, and converting between lists and arrays.

Features
List Creation: Initializes a list of eight names.
Sorting: Sorts the list in alphabetical order.
Shuffling: Randomly shuffles the list.
Searching: Searches for specific names in the list using binary search.
Conversion: Converts the list to an array and back to a list.
Program Flow
Original List: Displays the names in their original order.
Sorted List: Displays the names sorted in alphabetical order.
Shuffled List: Displays the names after shuffling them.
Search Results:
Finds and displays the index of "Alice" in the shuffled list.
Attempts to find "Zoe", which is not in the list, and displays the result.
Array Conversion:
Converts the list to an array and prints the names.
List from Array: Converts the array back to a list and prints the names.
Outputs
The program will print the following:

The list of names in their original, sorted, and shuffled orders.
The index of "Alice" in the shuffled list and the result of searching for "Zoe".
The names in the list after converting to an array and back to a list.
Key Concepts
Collections vs. Collection:
Collection: An interface in the Java Collections Framework representing a group of objects. It provides foundational methods for collections.
Collections: A utility class that provides static methods to operate on collections, such as sorting and shuffling.
